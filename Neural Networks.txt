Backpropagation

How to tackle it?

1) Successfully implement forward propagation
(This means you can pass inputs through your network and get an output. You will need the sigmoid function
for this)

2)Gradient Descent

3)Backpropagation
So you can actually use gradient descent, and compute the gradients
